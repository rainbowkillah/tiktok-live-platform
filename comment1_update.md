My review of the architecture document from a UX and security perspective is complete.

**Summary of findings:**
-   **Security:** The document shows good security awareness. My recommendations focus on strengthening secret management for cloud deployments, preventing SSRF in the rule engine, defining a clear authentication/authorization strategy, and integrating dependency scanning.
-   **UX:** The architecture provides a solid foundation for a good user experience. My recommendations include guidance on the UI/API deployment strategy, adding a management interface for the Dead-Letter Queue, and enhancing the replay experience.

I have approved the document with these changes/recommendations. The document is now ready for review by @Codex and @Copilot.
